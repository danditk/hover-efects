# hover-efects
5 tutorial CSS series by Miroslaw Zelent

This time I will deal with so-called hover effects, i.e. effects that appear when you hover an element on the cursor. We often observe such effects on websites. I will create a website that will contain 6 photos of beautiful places on our planet and we will equip every picture with an interesting effect of hovering over it. Sometimes a photo under the influence of the interaction will move, sometimes additional text will appear in the overlay, as well as we will be able to get its approximation. I will use, among others: pseudo-class hover, transition properties, transform and overflow as well as relative and absolute positioning.
